# ReactNativeJobFinder

A job finder app built using React Native. It uses React Navigation for navigating between screens, the Indeed API for search data, and Expo for Facebook login and push notifcations (along with Stephen Grider's rallycoding push notification API).

The app's use is limited to administrators and invited testers only, due to the restrictions of Facebook's developer platform. In addition, it is hardcoded to only search with specific criteria in a limited area, but has the potential for a search function to be added.
